- LSTM hidden layer sizes : 512
- Batch Size : 32

Total Model Params:
- 107403360

Compute:
- 1 RTX 4090 - Runpod
- Total Training Time: 1844.4981417655945

Final Losses:
- Loss:  2.8027687072753906
- Test Loss:  2.9320092099905013

Observation: Measuring loss through all 

Further Improvements: 
- Normalizing through Layernorm
- Implementing residuals proplery between blocks
